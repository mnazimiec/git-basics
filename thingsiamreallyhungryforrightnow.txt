I am really hungry for the following things: 
(1) Homemade Alfredo from my boyfriend 
(2) Bread... always bread... 
(3) Berries 
(4) Goat Cheese and Crackers
(5) Spicy Chicken Wings with, like, Wing Stop Ranch... oooo! or Hot Honey Wings, those are good!
Of course, not all at once, but these are foods I would like soon, hopefully! 

Oh, honorable mention... flaming hot puffcorn! It is so difficult to find around my house, so I drove 30 mins away to get some!
